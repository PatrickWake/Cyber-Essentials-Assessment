# Cyber Essentials Assessment

## Overview
Welcome to the **Cyber Essentials Assessment** repository. This repository contains reports, test results, and documentation related to the evaluation of the **Cyber Essentials** security framework. The purpose of this assessment is to analyse the effectiveness of Cyber Essentials security controls against modern cyber threats using real-world attack simulations and penetration testing methodologies.

## Objectives
- Evaluate the effectiveness of Cyber Essentials security controls.
- Identify gaps and areas for improvement within the framework.
- Document security test results, methodologies, and recommendations.
- Contribute research insights for improving Cyber Essentials compliance.

## Methodology
The assessment follows a structured penetration testing and security evaluation process, based on:
- **Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
- **Real-world exploitation techniques and security best practices**

### Key Testing Steps:
1. **Reconnaissance** - Gathering intelligence on the test environment.
2. **Threat Modelling** - Identifying potential attack vectors.
3. **Vulnerability Analysis** - Reviewing security configurations and policies.
4. **Exploitation** - Simulating real-world attacks against Cyber Essentials-compliant systems.
5. **Post-Exploitation** - Assessing the impact of successful attacks.
6. **Reporting** - Documenting findings and providing mitigation strategies.

## Key Findings
- **Malware Protection:** Evaluated the robustness of antivirus and endpoint security solutions.
- **Password Management:** Tested password policies and resistance to brute-force attacks.
- **Security Update Management:** Assessed the timeliness and effectiveness of patching mechanisms.
- **Network Security:** Reviewed segmentation, firewall configurations, and secure access controls.
- **Web Application Security:** Conducted vulnerability assessments on common web applications.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Understanding of **Cyber Essentials** principles and controls.
- Knowledge of **penetration testing** methodologies.
- Access to a test environment (e.g., virtual machines, cloud-based cyber range).

### Usage Instructions
1. **Review Reports:** Start with `cyber_essentials_assessment.pdf` for an overview of findings.
2. **Explore Scripts:** Use the provided scripts for security testing and validation.
3. **Read Documentation:** Understand the methodology and research insights.
4. **Contribute:** Suggestions and pull requests are welcome.
